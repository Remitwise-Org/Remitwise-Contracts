## Known Limitations

### SDK 21.0.0

1. **Storage Limits**: Standard Soroban storage limits apply
   - Max entry size: 64KB
   - TTL management required for long-term storage

2. **Cross-Contract Calls**: Limited call depth
   - Max depth: 4 levels
   - Orchestrator designed within limits

3. **Event Size**: Events have size limitations
   - Keep event data concise
   - Use references for large data

### Protocol 20

1. **Network Limits**: Standard network resource limits
   - Transaction size limits
   - Ledger entry limits
   - CPU/memory budgets

2. Review [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/issues)
3. Test with minimal reproduction case
4. Report with full version details

## Maintenance

This document is maintained alongside contract releases.

**Maintainer**: RemitWise Development Team

## Automated Compatibility Testing

To ensure long-term stability and safe version evolution, the workspace includes an automated compatibility matrix test suite located in `integration_tests/tests/multi_contract_integration.rs`.

### Test Coverage

1.  **Contract Upgrade Compatibility**: Validates that contracts can be upgraded (WASM update) while preserving all instance and persistent storage.
2.  **Version Matrix Interoperability**: Verifies that all contracts in the warehouse report consistent `CONTRACT_VERSION` levels and can interact correctly across versions.
3.  **Data Migration Consistency**: Ensures that the off-chain `data_migration` logic remains synchronized with on-chain snapshot data structures.

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test -p integration_tests
```

### Compatibility Requirements

- All new contract versions MUST implement `get_version() -> u32`.
- Storage layout changes MUST be accompanied by a migration path or documented as a breaking change.
- `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` MUST be incremented if internal data structures for export/import are modified.
